Classroom Tracker

A simple web app to track students in a classroom and estimate their grades. This project demonstrates JavaScript fundamentals, DOM manipulation, and basic HTML/CSS styling.

Features

Add Students: Increment the number of students in the classroom and update the status.

Show Grades: Display pass/fail status for a predefined set of student scores.

Dynamic UI: The page updates in real-time without refreshing.

Simple Styling: Clean and minimal interface using CSS.

Technologies Used

HTML5 – Structure and layout of the webpage.

CSS3 – Styling for buttons, lists, and background.

JavaScript – DOM manipulation, event handling, loops, conditionals, and functions.

How It Works

Student Counter:

The number of students is tracked using a variable.

Clicking Add Student increases the count and updates the message.

Grade Estimation:

A set of scores is evaluated using a function: scores ≥ 50 pass, others fail.

Clicking Show Grades generates a list of pass/fail messages.

Loops & Conditionals:

The app demonstrates for and while loops to iterate through subjects and countdown exams.

Conditionals handle classroom status and grade evaluation.

DOM Interaction:

Event listeners are used to respond to button clicks.

The background color and status text update dynamically based on actions.

Usage

Open index.html in a web browser.

Click Add Student to increment the student count.

Click Show Grades to view a list of students’ grades.

Example Output

Student Count: There are now 3 student(s) in the class.

Grade List:

Score 45: Fail

Score 67: Pass

Score 82: Pass

Score 30: Fail
